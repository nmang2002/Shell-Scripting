# Shell-Scripting

Finding all lines of sample code for my CSE-374 programming course. Used a wordcount executable to measure the size of the files and then
used an R script to create a scatterplot to look for patterns file sizes throughout the course.

Here, one shell script is used to all applicable source code urls (geturls), another obtains data about a single file (measurepage), and a 
third one combines the first two with R analysis (runanalysis).
