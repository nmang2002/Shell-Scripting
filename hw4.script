## Navya Mangipudi: Statement about scatterplot trends
## Based on what is seen in scatterplot_out.jpg, there is no trend to be found
## which correlates the size of the index page (y-axis) and the url number (x-axis).
## Initially, for the first 10 point, there seemed to be a linear positive correlation. 
## For the final portion of the graph, there was no correlation between the x and y axes. 
## Points seemed to be randomly scattered. The numbers printed when running scatterplot.R 
## were [1] 3697 and [1] 94.79487. When the file scatterplot.R is opened, the meaning of these
## numbers can be seen. The first number is the sum of all the words from the c files on the
## course page. The second number is the mean of all the words from the c files on the coursepage.
